# Script to assign roles to a service principal or user within an Azure subscription using `az cli`.
# This script documents the minimum required permissions to run the Azure infra and paragon Terraform workspaces.

# Define variables
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-azure-subscription-id"
PRINCIPAL_ID="your-service-principal-object-id-or-user-object-id"

# List of roles to assign at subscription level
# Note: Contributor role is sufficient for most operations, but we document specific roles
# for better security and compliance with least privilege principle.

ROLES=(
  # Contributor role - provides full access to manage all resources except grant access to others
  # This is the minimum role needed for Terraform to create and manage Azure resources
  "Contributor"
  # Needed to create role assignments (Key Vault RBAC + AKS Network Contributor on subnet/NSG)
  "User Access Administrator"
)

# Alternative: If you want to use more granular permissions instead of Contributor,
# you would need the following roles (but Contributor is simpler and sufficient):
#
# GRANULAR_ROLES=(
#   "Network Contributor"              # For Virtual Networks, Subnets, NSGs, Private Endpoints
#   "DNS Zone Contributor"             # For Private DNS Zones
#   "PostgreSQL Flexible Server Contributor"  # For PostgreSQL Flexible Servers
#   "Redis Cache Contributor"          # For Redis Caches
#   "Storage Account Contributor"      # For Storage Accounts
#   "Kubernetes Cluster Contributor"   # For AKS Clusters
#   "Virtual Machine Contributor"      # For VM Scale Sets (bastion)
#   "Key Vault Contributor"            # For Key Vaults (management plane)
#   "Key Vault Administrator"          # For Key Vault data-plane access (RBAC)
#   "User Access Administrator"        # For role assignments (RBAC)
# )
